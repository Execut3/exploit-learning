# Exploit Learning
This repository contains Exploit learning challenges (with my writeups), Techniques, Usefull Commands and Tools.

## Tools
For most of the challenges I used following tools:

- ```pwntools```, which is a python library (currently most suited for python2) and has a lot of usefull python packages for making connections, data manipulations and ...

- ```pwndbg``` which is a linux debugger that works on top of ```gdb```.

## Techniques & Commands

### Attach to gdb inside a docker
To attach gdb to a process inside a docker add to Dockerfile following lines for root user:

```bash
RUN apt -y install gdb gdbserver
RUN apt -y install procps
```

Inside the docker container do `gdbserver localhost:2001 --attach PID`.
On host do `target remote localhost:2001`. Also add `--privileged` and `-p 2001:2001` flags to docker run command.
