# Exploit Learning
This repository contains Exploit learning challenges with my writeups.

## Tools

- ```pwntools```, which is a python library (currently most suited for python2) and has a lot of usefull python packages for making connections, data manipulations and ...

- ```pwndbg``` which is a linux debugger that works on top of ```gdb``.
