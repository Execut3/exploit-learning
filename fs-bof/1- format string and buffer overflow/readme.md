First we need to gather some info about file, here are output of some commands:

```bash
$ file cookie-monster 
cookie-monster: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=998281a5f422a675de8dde267cefad19a8cef519, not stripped
```
From `file` command result, now we know that it's a 32bit elf binary.

Now checksec:

```bash
$ checksec --file=cookie-monster 
RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE             RPATH      RUNPATH	Symbols		FORTIFY	Fortified	Fortifiable	FILE
Partial RELRO   Canary found      NX enabled    No PIE          No RPATH   No RUNPATH   74) Symbols	  No	0	2cookie-monster

```
which will tell us that `Canary` is enabled for this binary.

Now let's try to run this file in IDE and see what we can find. We will use `ida pro 7` to decompile and look into this binary.
